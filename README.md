# WordsApp

This application was made as part of google's kotlin course.

Words is an app designed to demonstrate the use of intents for moving between activities.
First activity contains a list of all the alphabet.
The second activity contains five different words that starts with the selected letter.
Pressing a word will open the browser, searching for that word.

In this application I performed:
1. Using intent for navigation between activities
2. Passing information from one activity to another using putExtra method
3. Using companion objects
4. Running instrumentation tests
